## Postmortem: Outage of HnH Web Service
## Issue Summary:
### Duration:
> Start Time (UTC): 10/10/2023 06:37
> End Time (UTC): 10/10/2023 15:13

**Impact**: During the outage, HnH Web Service experienced complete downtime. Approximately 50% of the total users were affected, leading to a severe degradation of customer experience.

**Root Cause**: The outage was caused by an unexpected surge in traffic, leading to server overload and exhaustion of available database connections.

### Timeline:
Issue Detected: 10/10/2023 06:41, detected through monitoring alerts that indicated a spike in server load.
Actions Taken: The incident was initially assumed to be caused by a DDoS attack. Network configurations were inspected, but no anomalies were found.
Misleading Investigation: Further investigation led us to explore potential software bugs and performance bottlenecks. Several hours were spent analyzing code and fine-tuning configurations.
Escalation: After exhausting all software-related troubleshooting, the incident was escalated to the infrastructure team.
Resolution: The root cause, an unexpected traffic surge, was identified. Load balancing was implemented to distribute traffic evenly, and additional database connections were allocated. This relieved the strain on the system, and HnH Web Service was brought back online.

### Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause was the rapid influx of users and requests to HnH Web Service. This unexpected surge resulted in an overload on the server and exhausted the available database connections. As a result, users experienced timeouts and slow response times. 

To resolve the issue, load balancing was introduced, distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers. This helped in preventing server overload and ensured better handling of incoming requests. Additionally, the number of available database connections was increased, which enabled smoother interaction with the database and reduced database-related bottlenecks. These actions significantly improved HnH Web Service's stability and performance.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- Scaling and Load Balancing: Implement an auto-scaling solution that can dynamically adjust resources based on traffic. This ensures that HnH Web Service can handle traffic surges without downtime.

- Monitoring and Alerting: Enhance monitoring and alerting systems to detect unusual traffic patterns early and trigger alerts. Implement performance metrics that can help identify the root cause of future incidents more rapidly.

- Thorough Testing: Perform comprehensive stress and load testing regularly to prepare for traffic surges and ensure the system's robustness.

- Documentation: Maintain up-to-date documentation on the infrastructure and system configurations. This will aid in quicker issue resolution during incidents.

- Communication: Improve communication protocols for incident escalation to ensure faster issue resolution and minimal downtime.

- User Communication: Enhance communication with users during outages, providing transparent information about ongoing issues and estimated resolution times.

- Security Measures: Strengthen DDoS mitigation strategies to counteract potential attacks.

# Tasks to Address the Issue:
- Implement auto-scaling mechanisms.
- Enhance monitoring and alerting systems.
- Establish a routine schedule for stress and load testing.
- Maintain up-to-date infrastructure and system documentation.
- Revise and improve incident escalation protocols.
- Develop a user communication plan for outages.
